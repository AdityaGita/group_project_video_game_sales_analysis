# Video Games Analysis
> As the Data Analyst for my final group project, it was my responsibility to lead the data analytics efforts and ensure that the team produced impactful analysis using appropriate processes and tools. Additionally, I also played an active role in the visualization and presentation of our findings.

## Background Information
RATE, a fictional online video game distributor, serves retailers and end-users across North America, Europe, Japan, and other regions. 
The Head of Sales and Marketing has obtained [a dataset](www.kaggle.com%2Fdatasets%2Fkendallgillies%2Fvideo-game-sales-and-ratings) regarding the video game industry and plans to leverage the insights to devise strategies for increasing company revenue, which has remained stagnant for the past six months. The video game industry is constantly evolving with advancements in technology and the introduction of new platforms and games. It is imperative that RATE identifies a means of maintaining its business in this dynamic market.

## Objective
Devise strategies for enhancing the company's revenue and identify sustainable business practices to ensure the long-term success of the company.

## Analysis Methods
1. The scope of the dataset is published video games from 1980 to 2017's sales.
2. By utilizing Python for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, in conjunction with Tableau and Google Sheets for data visualization, we are able to provide insightful recommendations for the company. With the use of additional resources, we can further enhance the breadth and depth of our analysis.

## Key Findings

**More than 50%** of end users **do not have the interest** or **initiative to share their criticism score** on the video game that was released from 2012 to 2017.
As time goes on, **there are platforms that are decreasing in popularity**. If the game is still in the company's inventory, **it has the potential to become dead stock** in the warehouse.

## Recommendations
#### Quick Win Recommendations
- Deliver appropriate content that matches video game ratings.
- Provide video game genres and platforms based on every region's behavior and preferences. For example, action genre in NA, EU, & Other regions and Role-Playing in the JP region and focus to offer video games that could play on specific platforms.
- Offering referral and bundling promotion programs based on each region's behavior.
- Collaboration with the game influencers to increase customer acquisition.
- Increase engagement to retain end users, for example, active in the video game community.
- Raise the awareness to give critic scores from the game that their purchase and offer program/promo to encourage end use give critic scores as much as they can.
#### Long-Term Recommendations
- Business Transformation: With the current business model, we will shift from physical video games to digital and offer a product key platform. Establish an exclusive agreement with a console manufacturer who has an embedded app store to offer license/product keys to end-users.
- Business Diversification: With backward integration, we as distributors will transform the business into a game publisher and marketplace of PC gaming (all-in-one platform). Adopting the business model of STEAM.
